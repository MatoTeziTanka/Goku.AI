## 🎯 MISSION STATEMENT

**Goal:** Iteratively improve all repositories through Analyze → Review → Consensus → Fix cycles until v1.0.0 is achieved with 100/10 consensus (QC Score 95+/100) for all repositories in `C:\Users\sethp\Documents\Github`, ensuring:
- ✅ Complete understanding of purpose and development status
- ✅ Identification of misplaced, orphaned, or EOL files
- ✅ Consolidation of duplicate/related repositories
- ✅ Path to v1.0.0 (except GSMG.IO)
- ✅ World-class QC standards (100/10 mindset)

## 🔄 3-AGENT REVIEW PROCESS

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis (Per Repository)

**Step 1: Zencoder Code Agent**
- Deep analysis of repository structure
- Identify purpose, development status, file organization
- Find misplaced, orphaned, EOL files
- Identify consolidation opportunities
- Log all findings → `{REPO}-CODE-AGENT-ANALYSIS.md`

**Step 2: Review Agent**
- Review Code Agent's analysis
- Validate findings
- Identify gaps or disagreements
- Add additional insights
- Log review → `{REPO}-REVIEW-AGENT-VALIDATION.md`

**Step 3: Azure GPT-4.1 API**
- Review both agent analyses
- Build consensus
- Resolve conflicts
- Final recommendations
- Log consensus → `{REPO}-AZURE-CONSENSUS.md`

**Step 4: Compile Changes**
- Create `{REPO}-COMPILED-CHANGES.md` with:
  - All agreed-upon changes
  - All disagreements (with reasoning)
  - Priority levels
  - Implementation plan

---

### Phase 2: Implementation & Validation

**Step 5: Zencoder Code Agent (Implementation)**
- Execute agreed-upon changes
- Move files, consolidate repos, fix issues
- Log all actions → `{REPO}-CODE-AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION.log`

**Step 6: Review Agent (Validation)**
- Review implemented changes
- Verify correctness
- Test functionality
- Log validation → `{REPO}-REVIEW-AGENT-VALIDATION.log`

**Step 7: Azure GPT-4.1 API (Final Consensus)**
- Review implementation and validation
- Build final consensus
- Approve or request fixes
- Log final decision → `{REPO}-FINAL-CONSENSUS.md`

**Step 8: Final Compilation**
- Create `{REPO}-FINAL-REPORT.md` with:
  - Complete change log
  - Before/after state
  - QC scores
  - v1.0.0 readiness status
