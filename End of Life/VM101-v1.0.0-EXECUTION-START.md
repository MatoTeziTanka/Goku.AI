# 🚀 VM101 v1.0.0 - EXECUTION START

**Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ DEPLOYMENT PACKAGE READY  
**Next Step:** EXECUTE ON VM101

---

## ✅ PACKAGE VERIFICATION

**Location:** `VM101-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE-v1.0.0/`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (15 files)  
**Ready for:** Production Deployment

---

## 🎯 EXECUTION STEPS

### Step 1: Copy Package to VM101

**From your PC (Windows):**

```powershell
# Using SCP (if you have it)
scp -r VM101-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE-v1.0.0/ mgmt1@<VM101_IP>:~/

# OR using WinSCP / FileZilla
# Connect to: <VM101_IP>
# User: mgmt1
# Upload folder: VM101-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE-v1.0.0/
```

**OR manually via code-server:**
1. Open code-server: `http://<VM101_IP>:9001`
2. Upload the entire `VM101-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE-v1.0.0/` folder
3. Place it in `~/VM101-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE-v1.0.0/`

---

### Step 2: SSH to VM101 and Prepare

```bash
ssh mgmt1@<VM101_IP>
cd ~/VM101-DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE-v1.0.0/
chmod +x *.sh
ls -la *.sh  # Verify all scripts are executable
```

---

### Step 3: Review Execution Guide

```bash
cat DEPLOYMENT-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md
```

**Key Points:**
- Scripts will run automatically
- Logs saved to `~/.vm101-deployment/`
- Each task has error handling
- Rollback available if needed

---

### Step 4: Execute Master Script

**Option A: Full Automated Deployment (Recommended)**

```bash
./MASTER-DEPLOYMENT-EXECUTOR.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. ✅ Generates SSH keys for all 7 VMs
2. ✅ Deploys keys to Linux VMs (VM120, VM150, etc.)
3. ✅ Tests Windows deployment (VM100, VM200)
4. ✅ Verifies all services still running
5. ✅ Sets up monitoring and alerts
6. ✅ Runs QC verification

**Time:** ~2 hours (automated)

---

**Option B: Step-by-Step (If you want to monitor each step)**

```bash
# Task 1: Generate keys
./TASK-1.1-EXECUTE-SETUP.sh

# Review results, then continue
./TASK-1.2-DEPLOY-KEYS-LINUX.sh

# Review results, then continue
./TASK-1.3-TEST-WINDOWS.sh

# Review results, then continue
./TASK-1.4-VERIFY-SERVICES.sh

# Review results, then continue
./TASK-1.5-SETUP-MONITORING.sh

# Final verification
./QC-VERIFY-ALL.sh
```

**Time:** ~2-3 hours (with monitoring)

---

### Step 5: Monitor Progress

**In a separate terminal (or use `screen`/`tmux`):**

```bash
# Watch master log
tail -f ~/.vm101-deployment/MASTER-DEPLOYMENT-EXECUTOR-*.log

# Or watch all logs
tail -f ~/.vm101-deployment/*.log
```

**What to watch for:**
- ✅ "SUCCESS" messages
- ⚠️ "WARNING" messages (review but may be OK)
- ❌ "ERROR" messages (stop and investigate)

---

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

**After completion:**

```bash
# Run QC verification
./QC-VERIFY-ALL.sh

# Check results
cat ~/.vm101-deployment/QC-VERIFY-ALL-*.log
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All SSH keys generated
- ✅ At least 3 VMs have keys deployed
- ✅ SSH aliases work (e.g., `ssh vm120-proxy`)
- ✅ All services running
- ✅ Monitoring active

---

### Step 7: Test SSH Connectivity

```bash
# Test Linux VMs
ssh vm120-proxy "echo 'VM120 connection successful'"
ssh vm150-wordpress "echo 'VM150 connection successful'"

# Test Windows VM (if deployed)
ssh vm100-ai "echo 'VM100 connection successful'"
```

**Expected:** Should connect without password prompt

---

## 🚨 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
./ROLLBACK.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Restores original SSH keys from backup
- Removes new keys from target VMs
- Restores original SSH config
- Reverts all changes

**Backup location:** `~/.ssh/backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz`

---

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Read troubleshooting guide
cat TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md

# Check specific error logs
ls -la ~/.vm101-deployment/*.log
cat ~/.vm101-deployment/TASK-1.2-*.log  # Example: Check Task 1.2 logs
```

---

## 📊 POST-DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

After execution, verify:

- [ ] SSH keys generated in `~/.ssh/vm-keys/`
- [ ] SSH config updated with aliases
- [ ] At least 3 VMs accessible via SSH
- [ ] Docker still running: `docker ps`
- [ ] code-server accessible: `http://<VM101_IP>:9001`
- [ ] Monitoring logs exist: `ls ~/.vm101-deployment/`
- [ ] QC verification passed: `./QC-VERIFY-ALL.sh`
- [ ] No services broken
- [ ] Rollback tested (optional but recommended)

---

## 📝 UPDATE DOCUMENTATION

After successful deployment:

1. **Update VM101-MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md:**
   - Mark all tasks as ✅ COMPLETE
   - Add deployment date/time
   - Document actual results
   - Update status to "v1.0.0 DEPLOYED"

2. **Create deployment report:**
   - Which VMs got keys deployed
   - Any issues encountered
   - Time taken
   - Lessons learned

---

## 🎉 SUCCESS = v1.0.0

**v1.0.0 is complete when:**

✅ SSH keys deployed to at least 3 VMs  
✅ SSH connectivity verified  
✅ All services running

- ✅ Rollback capability
- ✅ Production-ready system

---

## ⏰ ESTIMATED TIMELINE

- **Copy package to VM101:** 5 minutes
- **Execute master script:** 2 hours (automated)
- **Verification & testing:** 30 minutes
- **Documentation update:** 30 minutes
- **Total:** ~3 hours to v1.0.0
