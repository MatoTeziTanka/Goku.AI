## 📞 HANDLING INQUIRIES

### **Common Questions:**

**Q: "What makes you different from Hostgator/Bluehost?"**
A: "Enterprise hardware. Hostgator uses cheap consumer drives in massive shared environments. We use Dell PowerEdge R730 with 480GB RAM and enterprise SSDs. Same hardware Fortune 500 companies use, but affordable for small businesses."

**Q: "Why should I trust a small hosting company?"**
A: "Transparency. Our entire infrastructure is documented on GitHub. You can see exactly what hardware we use, how we configure it, and how we isolate customers. Most big companies hide this. We don't."

**Q: "What if you go out of business?"**
A: "Fair question. That's why we offer VM exports and migration assistance. Your data is yours. Plus, Beta pricing is month-to-month - no long-term commitment."

**Q: "Do you offer support?"**
A: "Absolutely. Personal support from me (Seth), not outsourced to call centers. Email, ticket system, and we're working on live chat."

### **Inquiry Response Template:**
