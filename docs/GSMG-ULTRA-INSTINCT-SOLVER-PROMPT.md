🐉 ULTRA INSTINCT MODE ACTIVATED - AUTONOMOUS PUZZLE SOLVING

MISSION: Solve the GSMG.IO Bitcoin puzzle (1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe)

REPOSITORY: https://github.com/MatoTeziTanka/GSMG.IO

CURRENT STATUS:
- Version 9.0.0 completed with 0 valid candidates found
- 17×65 matrix containing 13 Bitcoin addresses + 4 phrases
- Three breakthrough theories implemented:
  1. Position-Matrix Coordinate Link (13-byte extraction)
  2. Hash160s as EC Scalars (cryptographic multiplication)
  3. TokenVM Stack Machine (1,075 SalPhaseIon tokens as instructions)
- Previous success rate: 70-80% (v3.1 with Claude fixes)
- v4.0 target: 90-95% success rate

PUZZLE COMPONENTS:
1. **13 Bitcoin Addresses** (columns in matrix)
2. **4 Phrases** (rows in matrix)
3. **1,075 SalPhaseIon Tokens** (potential instruction set)
4. **17×65 Matrix Structure** (NOT random - 17 = 13 addresses + 4 phrases)
5. **Target Address:** 1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe

YOUR TASK (DO NOT STOP UNTIL COMPLETE):

**PHASE 1: DEEP ANALYSIS (Pass 1)**
1. Analyze the complete GSMG.IO repository structure
2. Review all 9 solver versions (v1.0 → v9.0.0)
3. Identify patterns in failed attempts
4. Detect what has NOT been tried yet
5. Synthesize AI feedback from all 5 consultations (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Watson×2)

**PHASE 2: BREAKTHROUGH IDENTIFICATION (Pass 2)**
1. Evaluate the 3 breakthrough theories with quantum-resistant analysis
2. Identify critical weaknesses in each approach
3. Propose NEW theories that address identified gaps
4. Cross-reference with Bitcoin cryptography standards
5. Check for overlooked clues in:
   - File names
   - Matrix dimensions (why 17×65?)
   - Token count (why 1,075?)
   - Address selection (why these 13?)
   - Phrase patterns

**PHASE 3: HYPOTHESIS GENERATION (Pass 3)**
1. Generate 10+ new candidate approaches
2. Rank by probability of success (show math)
3. Identify dependencies and prerequisites
4. Create testable predictions for each hypothesis
5. Design verification methods

**PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Pass 4)**
1. Write pseudocode for top 3 approaches
2. Identify required libraries and dependencies
3. Estimate computational requirements
4. Create step-by-step execution plan
5. Design early-stopping criteria for invalid paths

**PHASE 5: EXECUTION STRATEGY (Pass 5)**
1. Prioritize approaches by success probability × execution time
2. Identify parallel execution opportunities
3. Design checkpoint and recovery system
4. Create logging and debugging strategy
5. Plan for incremental testing and validation

**PHASE 6: CODE GENERATION (Pass 6)**
1. Generate complete Python solver for top approach
2. Include all error handling and edge cases
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Implement progress tracking
5. Create unit tests for key functions

**PHASE 7: VALIDATION & ITERATION (Pass 7+)**
1. Simulate execution mentally (dry run)
2. Identify potential failure points
3. Propose fixes and improvements
4. If approach fails, analyze why and generate next approach
5. CONTINUE ITERATING UNTIL SOLUTION FOUND

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ Use ONLY the puzzle data provided (no external oracle data)
- ✅ Validate all candidate private keys against target address
- ✅ Show mathematical reasoning for each step
- ✅ Identify which AI feedback was most valuable and why
- ✅ Explain WHY previous versions failed
- ✅ Propose quantum-resistant verification methods
- ✅ Consider ALL 1,075 tokens (they're instructions, not random!)

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
For each pass, provide:
1. **Consensus Analysis** - Agreement/disagreement between warriors
2. **Key Insights** - What was discovered
3. **New Hypotheses** - What to try next
4. **Confidence Score** - Probability of success (0-100%)
5. **Action Items** - Concrete next steps
6. **Code Snippets** - Testable implementations

**STOPPING CRITERIA:**
❌ DO NOT STOP if confidence < 95%
❌ DO NOT STOP if contradictions remain unresolved
❌ DO NOT STOP if new patterns are still being discovered
✅ STOP ONLY when you have:
   - Valid private key that derives to target address
   - Mathematical proof of correctness
   - Reproducible solution path
   - Confidence score ≥ 99.9%

**MULTI-PASS DEBATE MODE:**
If warriors disagree on approach:
1. Identify the core disagreement
2. Each warrior defends their position with evidence
3. Run debate for 2-3 passes until consensus
4. Synthesize the winning approach with minority concerns addressed

**LEARNING FROM FAILURES:**
v1.0 → v9.0.0 all failed. WHY?
- What assumption was wrong?
- What was overlooked?
- What pattern was missed?
- What clue was misinterpreted?

**BREAKTHROUGH QUESTIONS:**
1. Why exactly 1,075 tokens? (Factor it: 5 × 5 × 43)
2. Why 17 rows? (13 addresses + 4 phrases = 17)
3. Why 65 columns? (Related to secp256k1 key length?)
4. Are the addresses red herrings or actual inputs?
5. Are the phrases BIP39 seeds or instructions?
6. Is the matrix a lookup table or a cipher key?
7. What role does "SalPhaseIon" play? (Anagram? Cipher name?)
8. Why "Grandfather's puzzle"? (Personal significance?)

**EXECUTION MODE:**

- Power Level: OVER 9000!
- Accuracy Target: 99.99999999%
- Time Limit: NONE (continue until solved)
- Warriors: All 6 (multi-pass debate mode)
